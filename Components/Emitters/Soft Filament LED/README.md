# Soft Filament LED

## Components 
### Soft Filament LED

* Is used as indicator, using a low electricity and lasts really long. Most common one is 5mm LED.
* mm refers to diameter of LED (3mm and 10mm are also common).
* It needs the use of a resistor to not burn out, as it needs to be connected to a voltage source and ground.
* It has an **Anode** (hole) which is connected to voltage source trough resistor and a **Cathode** which is connected directly to ground.

### Resistor
* Resist the flow of electricity. The higher the value of the resistor, the more it resists and the less electrical current will flow through it. 
* We can use a resistor to limit how much current flows through the LED and therefore, how brightly it shines.
* The unit of resistance is called the Ohm, which is usually shortened to Ω the Greek letter Omega.
* Resistors do not have a positive and negative lead. They can be connected either way around.
