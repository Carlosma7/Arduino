# Nano Extension Shield

## Components 
### Nano Extension Shield

* With this board, in addition to facilitating the connections of the Arduino Nano, we can expand the hardware capacity. This Shield uses the 3P configuration, which expands each input/output pin of the microcontroller to 3 pins (Signal, 5V and GND), making it much easier to connect servo motors and sensors.
* The board includes a 3.3V voltage regulator but if we need more power for modules or sensors that we connect to the pins we can opt for a version of this board that has a more powerful voltage regulator that delivers 5V and 2A. This board differs at first glance by having 2 electrolytic capacitors and a coil between the 2 socket connectors of the Arduino Nano, and also has a switch with the options "Sensor 5V Out" and "Micro 5V Out" with which we can choose to deliver 5V to the red pins for sensors / actuators or give them to the Arduino Nano.
