# Avoid

## Components 
### Avoid

* Infrared IR Sensor Obstacle Avoidance Sensor board is an inexpensive solution to avoidance detection for robotics, smart car, and other electronic uses.
* Infrared Obstacle Sensor Module has a built-in IR transmitter and IR receiver that sends out IR energy and looks for reflected IR energy to detect the presence of any obstacle in front of the sensor module. 
* The module has an onboard potentiometer that lets users adjust the detection range. The sensor has a very good and stable response even in ambient light or in complete darkness.
