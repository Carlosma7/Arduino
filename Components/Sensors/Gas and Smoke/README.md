# Gas and Smoke

## Components 
### Gas Smoke

* MQ-2 is a Combustible Gas and Smoke Sensor. This sensor can also detect LPG, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane, and Carbon Monoxide.
* The MQ-2 gas sensor needs a heating element in order to properly detect combustible glasses but, a heating element close to combustible gasses could be disastrous, so the sensor is manufactured with an anti-explosion network made out of two thin layers of stainless steel mesh as you can see in the image below. The heating element is placed inside this stainless steel mesh
